  Consider the following game state:
  - Player Name: {{{playerName}}}
  - Bingo Count: {{{bingoCount}}}
  - Is Winner: {{{isWinner}}}
  - Called Word: {{{calledWord}}}
  - Remaining Players: {{{remainingPlayers}}}
  - Win Condition: {{{winCondition}}}

  Generate a short, positive, and encouraging feedback message for the player. Tailor the feedback based on their progress and the game state. Be enthusiastic and uplifting.

  Examples:
  - If the player is winning: "Great job, {{{playerName}}}! You're in the lead with {{{bingoCount}}} bingos! Keep it up!"
  - If the player is close to winning: "Nice call, {{{playerName}}}! You're getting close with {{{bingoCount}}} bingos! Just a little more!"
  - If the player is not winning: "Good effort, {{{playerName}}}! Every word counts. You are at {{{bingoCount}}} bingos. Don't give up!"
  - If there are only 2 players left: "Intense round, {{{playerName}}}! You called {{{calledWord}}}. Only you and another player remain, make every move count!"
  - If the game just started, you can include the called word: "{{{playerName}}}, {{{calledWord}}} is a great choice!"
